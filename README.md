# My_Project
Right now the code for this project is more or less a copy of what we worked on in the last workshop with a few changes.
Once it is finished I intend for this app to be a virtual portfolio for visual artists, where they can upload their work.
Kind of like instagram, but focused exclusively on visual art.
Artists can log in, and upload pieces, that will be connected to their profile.
